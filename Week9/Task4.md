# Task 4 – Answers

1. Purpose of `<EditForm>` is to create a form that collects user input and validates it.

2. Model="@product" required because it tells the form which object to store data in and validate.

3. @bind-Value is used because it connects the input field to the model property and updates it automatically.

4. HandleValidSubmit() is used because it runs the code only when the form data is valid.

5. HandleValidSubmit() will be called when the user submits the form and all validation rules are satisfied.

6. If user clicks Submit without required fields, validation errors are shown and the form is not submitted.

7. [Parameter] is required for Id because it allows the page to receive the Id value from the URL.
